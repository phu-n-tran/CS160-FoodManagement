##Motivation
Food waste is a problem worth solving for many reasons. At a personal level, users can get their moneyâ€™s worth of the food they purchase and more accurately estimate the amount of food they should buy on a regular basis. At the global level, preventing or minimizing food waste will reduce our carbon footprint and help improve the environment.
